_"Hey, my name is Jen and I've been doing some research on code schools in the area. HackerSchool is $2000 less than your program, and allows for part time. Why choose TIY?"_

Good question. You should choose TIY because we have skilled full-time instructors with lots of extra incentive to keep the students successful. Each city has an advisory board to make sure the subjects being taught are relevant to those hiring in the industry. We are the biggest code school in the world so our hiring and support networks, as well as our community, are bigger and more diverse than other code schools.
