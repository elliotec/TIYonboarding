_What's The Iron Yard, and how did you all start?_

Good question. The Iron Yard is the largest code school in the world, which actually began as a startup accelerator in Greenville, SC. They soon started to teach free kids code camps, and then adult code classes. They are currently expanding rapidly and have over 20 campuses with more to come.
